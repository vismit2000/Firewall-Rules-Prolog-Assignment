## Firewall Rules
Assignment for Logic in Computer Science (CS F214) course at BITS Pilani. Implementing rules for a Firewall (over a network) in Prolog language.

To run this project, you will need SWI Prolog which can be downloaded [here](http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable).

## User Interface
- The top level procedure is printStatus(<’packetname’>)

- The procedure prints Packet Accepted, Packet Rejected or Packet Dropped. If there is a conflict in the status of the packet according to the rules, priority is given to reject, then drop, and then accept.

- Example:  
```
    ?- printStatus('pack1').
    Packet Accepted
```

## Rule base
- The rule base contains rules as required. Each rule starts with an accept,reject or drop predicate. Each is a unary predicate, which takes a string argument.

- The default behaviour of the program is to accept; which means that if the packet is unmatched to any of the rules, it will be accepted. 

- Examples:
```
    accept(‘ip src addr 172.24.6.31’).
    reject(‘adapter C-F’).
    drop(‘ether vid 3-199 proto 0x0800,0x86dd’).
```

## Packet Input Format
- Each packet is encoded in the database within the predicate packet(<'packet_name',attribute_list>).
'packet_name' is any string.
attribute_list is a list containing 16 attributes of the packet, all enclosed in quotes. Not all of these attributes will be applicable for a given packet.
```
['Src_ip','Dst_ip','Adapter_num','Protocol_type', 'Icmpv6_type','Icmpv6_Msgcode','Vlan_Id', 'TCPSrc','TCPDst','UDPSrc','UDPDst','IPV6Src','IPV6Dst','ICMPType','ICMPCode','protocolId']
```

- The terms are described below:

    - Src_ip: The ipv4 address of the source.
    - Dst_ip: The ipv4 address of the destination.
    - Adapter_num: Adapter number, an upper case character between A and H. Note: Specified in double quotes rather than single.
    - Protocol_type: The protocol type specified in ip datagram clause (tcp/udp) Note: Specified in double quotes rather than single.
    - Icmpv6_type: Protocol type specified in icmpv6 conditions(integer)
    - Icmpv6_Msgcode: message code specified in icmp conditions(integer).
    - Vlan_Id: Virtual LAN Id (Integer, specified in the ethernet clause) 
    - TCPSrc:TCP port number of source between 0 and 65535.
    - TCPDst:TCP port number of destination between 0 and 65535.
    - UDPSrc:UDP port number of source between 0 and 65535.
    - UDPDst:UDP port number of destination between 0 and 65535.
    - IPV6Dst: ipv6 address of source
    - IPV6Dst: ipv6 address of destination
    - ICMPType: Protocol type in ipv6 
    - ICMPCode: Message code in ipv6
    - protocol-id : The protocol id specified in the 'ether proto <protocol_id>' clause

The parameters for ipv4 and ipv6 are mutually exclusive; so are the parameters for tcp and udp. For the values not to be given, an asterisk '*' should be used.
